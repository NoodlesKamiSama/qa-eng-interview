### Using the provided Cypress project, write an automated test that performs the following:

1. Using a pre-defined prompt to generate a slide, verify that the prompt generates the correct type of slide
2. Create a useful test with your own prompt, ensuring the test is repeatable and maintainable. At your discretion, validate the resulting slide that is created.

You will need to run `npm install` after cloning the project.
Run `npx cypress open` to open the Cypress runner.
In its initial state, the test will navigate you to the page you'll write tests against.
